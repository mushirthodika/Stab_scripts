# Stab_scripts

This repository contains the scripts required for extracting the electron-attached states of a given symmetry from a set of EOM-EA-CCSD based stabilization calculations.

energy-script.sh --> Extracts the energies in eV from the QChem output files.

muller.m --> A secant method for finding the roots of a real/complex polynomial.

stab_analysis.m --> MATLAB code for performing (3,3,3) order analytic continuation.

stab_analysis_444.m --> MATLAB code for performing (4,4,4) order analytic continuation.

stab_analysis_555.m --> MATLAB code for performing (5,5,5) order analytic continuation.
